This is a sample post with TeX blocks.

This is a TeX block:
$$latex
y = \int_0^\infty \gamma^2 \cos(x) dx $ this is after the block.

This is an inline Tex block: $$latex \cos(x) $ and this is after.

This is two seperate inline Tex blocks: $$latex \sin(x) $ and then $$latex \tan(x) $ and this is after.

This is a mistyped TeX block because I didn't terminate it properly. $$latex \tan(x)$ and this text is rendered too because I didn't put a space before the dollar sign $

This is a broken TeX block because I didn't put a space before it$$latex \tan(x) $
